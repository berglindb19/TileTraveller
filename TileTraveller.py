# Algorithm
# For every tile that the user is located at any given time, the user is told in what direction he can travel.
# User chooses one of these directions, but if he chooses a direction that is not one of the option the program prints "Not a valid direction!"
# When the user enters the (3,1) tile he wins, it's the victory tile. 
# At the beginning of the game the variable named victory = False
# Also, at the beginning of the game we need to give beginning tile, which is (1,1)
# Throughout the game a loop runss while victory != False 
# Use if-sentences for every tile to tell the user in which dircetion he can travel
# When the user/player wins the game, at tile (3,1) the victory variable turns into True
